[See how it looks](https://grimmori.vercel.app/)

this is my portfolio. it has been developed using React and Vite. feel free to use it as a template for your own portfolio.

to use this project you will have to clone the repository.

then go to the project directory and run this command to install the packages.

    $npm install

to run the server and see the application running you can use this command:

    $npm run dev

this project uses a json file to imitate a database. that is src/components/work/projects.json

keep in mind that if you modify the model of the projects you will also have to modify the component that renders them. that is src/components/Projects.tsx

don't forget to change the favicon ^^
